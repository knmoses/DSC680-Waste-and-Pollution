## File Information

Project Proposal: "Project 1 - Proposal.pdf"

Jupyter Notebook Code: "Waste and Pollution.ipynb"

Presentation: "Waste and pollution.pptx"

## Results
1. The amount of waste in millions is shown as rapidly increasing as the years go on. In 2017, 26.8 million tons of plastic
were sent to landfills.

2. It was determined that the amount of waste has been increasing over the years and the primary material found is paper
and paperboard. Throughout the years, there has been an increase in plastic waste; however, a decrease in glass. With the
decrease in glass, it tells me that this is due to recycling. A lot of glass is also repurposed to serve other needs for
people.

3. Plastics can take up to 400 years to break down and a lot can happen within that time.

4. While the amount of waste keeps piling up, the data also has been evolving in ways to identify certain waste products to
pull from landfill. The more we can identify, the more machines can pull.

5. There are solutions that we can take now to reduce the amount of waste we are producing. Some of those solutions
include buying in bulk, choosing to reuse a water bottle, using utensils from home, using a reusable bag, and simple things
like cutting the strings off disposable masks can help with sea life.
